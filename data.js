        incorrectAnswers: ["A high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.", "A high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.", "A general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the Java programming language, or \"Java with Classes\"."],
        correctAnswer: "A client-side and server-side scripting language inserted into HTML pages and is understood by web browsers. Also a Object-based Programming language ",

        question: "2. Enumerate the differences between Java and JavaScript?",
        incorrectAnswers: ["Java is a markup language used to create static web pages and web applications. Javascript is a style sheet language responsible for the presentation of documents written in a markup language.", "Java is a statically typed and compiled language, and Javascript is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This single difference makes Java faster at runtime and easier to debug, but Javascript is easier to use and easier to read", "Java is a compiled language that is it converts the code into machine language so that it could be understood by the machine or system. Javascript is an Interpreted language that is in Javascript, the code is first transformed into bytecode and that bytecode is then executed by the JVM (Javascript Virtual Machine)."],
        correctAnswer: " Java is a complete programming language. In contrast, JavaScript is a coded program that can be introduced to HTML pages. These two languages are not at all inter-dependent and are designed for different intent. Java is an object-oriented programming (OOPS) or structured programming languages like C++ or C, whereas JavaScript is a client-side scripting language.",

        question: "3. What are JavaScript Data Types?",

        question: "4. What is the use of isNaN function?",
        incorrectAnswers: ["isNan returns a function that is called when a number is passed in as an argument", "isNan function returns false if the argument is a number", "isNan function checks if the argument is a string"],
        correctAnswer: "isNan function returns true if the argument is not a number; otherwise, it is false.",

        question: "5. Which is faster between JavaScript and an ASP script?",
        incorrectAnswers: ["ASP script is faster. ASP script is a client-side language,, and thus it does not need the assistance of the webserver to execute. On the other hand, Javascript is a server-side language and hence is always slower than ASP script.", "Both are just as fast because bother are scripting languages that can run server side and browser side", "They Both require the same amount of time to execute."],
        correctAnswer: "JavaScript is faster. JavaScript is a client-side language,, and thus it does not need the assistance of the webserver to execute. On the other hand, ASP is a server-side language and hence is always slower than JavaScript. Javascript now is also a server-side language (nodejs).",
